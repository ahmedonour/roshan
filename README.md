This was our graduation project , the idea of the website is to sell ,buy & rent property  with out a broker , and make it just person-to-person operation , also to reduce the time and effort involved in the property search process.
I used EJS , CSS & JavaScript for the front-end , and NodeJS , ExpressJS & SQLite3 , for the back-end
